Hi Di😃,

Aksh here.

This was created with a personal portfolio in mind but, I think that just changing a bit in the design will do for what you want it for🤷‍♂️.

The whole thing was made by me but, some logos were made by a friend(the Canadian dude I talk about). He should not have any issues with you using it yet, I will ask him if you are worried about "usage rights"👍.

Also, I have used some images that aren't mine but, just got those from google and, some text from google as well........



I have tried my best with commenting on it but yet, if there's an issue, feel free to hit me(not literally😅...... Please.......😂) anytime.....
